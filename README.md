# Apptension Tech Radar

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).<br />
Follow [this document](https://github.com/apptension/tech-radar/blob/master/docs/create-react-app.md) to read about available scripts & more about Create React App.

Additionally, it's easily deployable to GitHub pages thanks to this recipe: [Deploying a React App* to GitHub Pages](https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages)


## Deployment

Page is available here: https://apptension.github.io/tech-radar/

To deploy any updates, you can either:
* push changes to `gh-pages` branch,
* run `yarn run deploy` in project root, which will build static version on your local machine, 
and automatically push it to `gh-pages` branch for you,
